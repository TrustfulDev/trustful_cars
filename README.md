### Trustful Cars
- Tailwind + React
- Hosted on Fleek (images will load slow causing content resizing)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand tailwind
- Page routing with react-router-dom
- File/Folder Structure

## Notes
- IOS seems to stretch the image (unsure about fix, works fine on pc)
- Could use a more unique design. (Simple for the sake of learning tailwind)
- Could've spent a bit more time adding features, but FALL 2022 semester is kicking in
- Icon needs a repaint
- Need all photos to match in size or else stretching will occur on CarDetail screen (Photoshop?)
- Could use way more photos/cars (database?)

### Packages Used
- react-icons
- react-router-dom
- @headlessui/react
